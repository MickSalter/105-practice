Notes from Darin's Call:

"one stop shop for KLF" 

----> Want it to happen so badly! YAY! 
----> Taking care of the customer. 
----> Their needs.

----> Fleur Detroit - 16 year old estate company. Gardens, porch pot, full service florist, garden shop. Full service events team. Floral production. In house caterer, caligrapher. One stop shop for everything. Suggest music, they do. All of those people and all of the right people. He has been doing it for 15 years. All about planning an experience. The moment that he sits down with you. Trust and needs. 

----> Small combo to 1,000 people with a band of 48 that interchanges. Cocktail hour, brunch the next day. Loves live music and it what makes or break the party. Loves sound and music and sound. Professionalism is very important. We are there to entertain the guests, not to be entertained. DJ's drinking on the job and not professional. Providing a service that we are paying for. Guest interaction through singers.
 
----> Know your place. Better not see it or smell it or deal with it. 

----> Always looking for something new, new talent. Local beat boxer. Always about something live with a DJ or a DJ combo. LOVES live. 

----> Unique parties, that was such a cool thing!! Special moments!! Has clients that WILL PAY! About 20k. 

----> 10 pc band. Loved working with them. Flexible. Smallest to largest. Not waste people's time. AYAYYAYAYAYAY!!!!!

----> How to connect:
Here are all my details with guests and links and this is what they're looking for - I'm thinking this, what do you have that's cool? 

----> leans to us on what would be best
a week to get proposals back to you. Christa is the admin for Darin. Very similar. 

----> Leaning for pricing. What does this cost? Once we have pricing together. DJ/Percussion 5K for 6 hours. 12 pc with dancers. Expectation would rather give you less than more. Then I can let them know. No hidde numbers, come up with a standard rate.

----> Other than the basic rider. Including travel and things like that. Wants sound and lighting. See you in a couple weeks!

----> Does have a couple production companies that he works with, he just doesn't know if the price would be willing. Worth
